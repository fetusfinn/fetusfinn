hi, im a student from new zealand [studying game dev](https://www.mediadesignschool.com/courses/game-development-courses-degrees), with an interest in engine, and tools development, i enjoy building the things that other things run on, i mainly use c++, with some lua, c#, php, and python thrown in, and im planning on using more lua for embedded scripting
