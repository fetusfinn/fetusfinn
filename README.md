hi, im a student from [new zealand](https://www.newzealand.com/) [studying game dev](https://www.mediadesignschool.com/courses/game-development-courses-degrees) with an interest in engine, and tools development, i enjoy building the things that other things run on (backend dev), i mainly use c++, with some lua, c#, php, and python thrown in, but im planning on using more lua for embedded scripting, im currently working on building a very basic game with minimal features so that i can use it as a testing environment for tools and other features that im planning on building, as well as building up the engine that runs it, with the end goal being me building my own game engine

i originally got into programming to learn how to make my own website, then transitioned to c++ when i found one of the early csgo cheats for macOS ([microwave](https://github.com/vikingmicrowave/Microwave-Open-Source), shoutout viking) and wanted to tweak it and make it more my own, which ultimately lead to me building my own macOS csgo cheat ([pwnhk](https://github.com/fetusfinn/pwnhk)) that i ended up selling as a subscription, and i guess that laid the foundations of where i am now
